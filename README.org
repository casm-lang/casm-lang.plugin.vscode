* casm-lang.plugin.vscode

CASM language extension integration for the language client [[https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode][vscode-editor]].

The vscode extension/plugin calls directly a =casmd= language server process and 
communicates through the stdin/stdout stream with the application
where the [[https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol][language server protocol]] (LSP) is implemented.

Based on  
https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang-tools-extra
revision 96c47487d46eb6f1ddb97f6cf27eef754f5a5f09
and information from
